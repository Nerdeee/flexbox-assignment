    <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
    <p>The big idea of the lesson, was learning how to save our work properly, and also how we should collaborate safely and effectively. A file can be committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that Git has officially taken a snapshot of the files in the staging area, and has stored them. Modified means that the file has been seen before, but has been changed, so is not ready to be snapshotted by Git. When staged, the file is stored in its current state to your local repository (repo). </p>
